Welcome!

Here is the codebase you are going to work on.

Please Fork this repository and clone it on your computer.

This code is the begining of our next product that will help companies manage their workforce.
You will be asked to develop new features and make improvements.

If you are uneasy with python, you will have the possibility of writing your answers in another language of your choice.

To be able to execute the code you will need to have python 3 installed. No other library will be necessary.

Please take a few minutes to explore the code before the interview.

To execute the code, just run this in your command line tool:
```
python main.py
```

Please note that if you have multiple versions of python installed you may need to execute something like:
```
python3.6 main.py
```

Let's get started!
